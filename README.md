# Glyn's Sass Library

### Welcome to my Library of css ready sass components

This is a library of the types of CSS I use on a regular basis, I have turned this into an easily accessible library to make the building of websites and app easier as I am able to contain several css properties into a single CSS identifier.

I have a large color library that has been separated into shades of specific colors as well as a grid system that is responsive through the simplified use of media queries.

The usual array of components are available such as __Buttons__, __Cards__, etc...
